### ðŸš€ **Current Project: Chatbot with Azure**

I'm currently working on a **chatbot project hosted on Azure**, designed to [briefly describe what the chatbot does, e.g., provide customer support, assist in tech troubleshooting, etc.].  
The project leverages **FastAPI** for the API layer, **Streamlit** for the user interface, and **Azure services** for hosting and deployment.  
This project is an exciting challenge where Iâ€™m combining **AI**, **cloud architecture**, and **automation** to deliver a scalable solution.
